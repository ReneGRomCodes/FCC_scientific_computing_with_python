# FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python (Beta) Certificate

Welcome to my repository for the programs written during the lessons of the FreeCodeCamp "Scientific Computing with
Python (Beta) Certificate" course!

## Overview

This repository contains all the programs written as part of the lessons in the FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with
Python course. Each program corresponds to a specific lesson or project within the course.

## Contents

The repository is organized into files, each corresponding to a different section or topic covered in the course.
Within each file, you'll find the Python code written for that particular lesson.

## Contents of 'Cert_projects' folder

The programs in this folder are solutions to tasks assigned by FreeCodeCamp as part of the certification process. Unlike
the other programs in this course, which guide you step by step through the learning process, these projects were
independently completed from start to finish.

## Getting Started

To explore the programs in this repository, simply navigate through the files to find the code for each lesson or
project. You can view the code directly in your browser or download it to your local machine to run and experiment with.
